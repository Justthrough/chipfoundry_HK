### Microwatt + GPIO Controller

Hackathon Proposal â€“ Microwatt Momentum 2025

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project extends the Microwatt open-source POWER CPU core with a General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) controller.

The GPIO peripheral allows Microwatt to:

Read inputs (e.g., switches, buttons, or sensors).

Write outputs (e.g., LEDs, buzzers, or actuators).

This demonstrates how Microwatt can act as the central processor in an embedded system by controlling external devices, a key requirement for real-world IoT and SoC applications.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Design a GPIO peripheral with memory-mapped registers for input/output.

Integrate the peripheral with the Microwatt CPU core on the OpenFrame platform.

Write a simple program that toggles an LED based on switch input.

Provide testbenches and simulation waveforms to verify functionality.

Document the design flow to ensure reproducibility for the community.


### Register Map

GPIO_IN (0x80000000) â†’ Read-only register capturing external input pin values.

GPIO_OUT (0x80000004) â†’ Read/Write register controlling output pins.

Example Software Flow

Read GPIO_IN.

If 1 â†’ write 1 to GPIO_OUT (LED ON).

Else â†’ write 0 to GPIO_OUT (LED OFF).

### ðŸ”¬ Verification Plan

Simulation (Required):

Use Verilator or GHDL to simulate Microwatt + GPIO.

Testbench drives input pins with patterns (0/1).

Expected output register changes are observed in GTKWave.

FPGA Demo (Optional, if hardware available):

Map input pins to board switches.

Map output pins to LEDs.

Run the C program â†’ pressing a switch lights up an LED.
